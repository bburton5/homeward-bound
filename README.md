# HOMEWARD BOUND

## Description 

We made this website because we wanted a user friendly site that was able to help people look for their missing pets. By logging, in you are able to search in our database (and King County) to see where any missing reported pets have been. Also by logging in, you are able to add your own pet to the database so others are able to keep an eye out in the King County area.
